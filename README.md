# Loan-Deafulter-Project
Data is provided by the XYZ corp to predict the defaulters.In this project I have to put myself in the shoes of a loan issuer and manage credit risk by using the past data and deciding whom to give the loan to in the future. 
The data contains the indicator of default, payment information, credit history, etc.
The data should be divided into train (June 2007 - May 2015) and out-of-time test (June 2015 - Dec 2015) data. I will have use the training data to build models/analytical solution and finally apply it to test data to measure the performance and robustness of the models. 


Objective :To build a data model to predict the probability of default, and choose a cut-off based on what you feel is suitable. Alternatively you can also use a modelling technique which gives binary output.
