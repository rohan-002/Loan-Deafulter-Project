Conclusion

With regards to the XZY Corp. loan defaulters dataset;
We performed Logistic Regression initially and even with a high accuracy score, the precision values of the class of importance 
i.e. 1 were low at 0.30. 
Next, we performed Decision Tree and received a high accuracy as well as high precision and recall values for both classes.
Therefore, we will produce the Decision Tree model to XYZ Corp. to predict future defaults.
Additionally, we were able to provide to the client the loss that maybe incurred based on incorrectly predicted loan defaulters 
which is $ 25,550 totally as shown in the below code snippet.
